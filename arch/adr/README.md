# What is this folder for?

This folder is intended to store ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

# What is an ADR?

The concept of ADRs is explained here: https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record

# What template should we use for ADRs?

The currently chosen template is the one proposed here: https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard

However, it can be changed later on.
